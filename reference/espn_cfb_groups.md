# **ESPN College Football Groups & Conferences**

Get the full ESPN group hierarchy for a college football season – the
division roll-ups (Division I, FBS, FCS) and every conference nested
beneath them, flattened into one catalog table.

## Usage

``` r
espn_cfb_groups(year = NULL, season_type = 2)
```

## Arguments

- year:

  (*Integer* required): Season, 4 digit format (*YYYY*).  
  Minimum value accepted: 2001

- season_type:

  (*Integer* default 2): ESPN season type id. `2` = regular season is
  the sensible default.

## Value

A data frame with one row per group:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | types | description |
| season | integer | Season (4-digit year). |
| season_type | integer | ESPN season type id queried. |
| group_id | character | ESPN group id. |
| name | character | Group / conference name. |
| abbreviation | character | Group abbreviation. |
| short_name | character | Group short name. |
| is_conference | logical | `TRUE` for an actual conference, `FALSE` for a division roll-up. |
| parent_group_id | character | `group_id` of the parent node (`NA` at the root). |
| slug | character | Group slug. |
| group_ref | character | `$ref` URL to the group resource. |
| standings_ref | character | `$ref` URL to the group standings resource. |

## Details

Wraps the ESPN core-v2 endpoint
`sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/college-football/seasons/{year}/types/{season_type}/groups`.
ESPN's group index only exposes two top-level groups; the conferences
sit several levels deep under `children`. This wrapper walks the tree
recursively, dereferencing every node, and returns one row per group.
Filter `is_conference == TRUE` for the actual conferences (ACC, SEC, Big
Ten, ...); the `group_id` of a conference is what
[`espn_cfb_standings()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_standings.md)
accepts as `group_id`. The `parent_group_id` column lets you reconstruct
the division -\> conference nesting.
