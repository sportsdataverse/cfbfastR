# **ESPN College Football Season Weeks**

Get the calendar of weeks ESPN tracks for a college football season type
– each week's number, label, and start / end dates.

## Usage

``` r
espn_cfb_season_weeks(year = NULL, season_type = 2)
```

## Arguments

- year:

  (*Integer* required): Season, 4 digit format (*YYYY*).

- season_type:

  (*Integer* default 2): ESPN season type id. `2` = regular season (the
  only type with a meaningful week calendar), `3` = postseason, `1` =
  preseason.

## Value

A data frame with one row per week:

|             |           |                                       |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| col_name    | types     | description                           |
| season      | integer   | Season (4-digit year).                |
| season_type | integer   | ESPN season type id queried.          |
| week        | integer   | Week number.                          |
| text        | character | Week label (e.g. `Week 1`, `Bowls`).  |
| start_date  | character | Week start timestamp (ISO 8601, UTC). |
| end_date    | character | Week end timestamp (ISO 8601, UTC).   |
| week_ref    | character | `$ref` URL to the week resource.      |

## Details

Wraps the ESPN core-v2 endpoint
`sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/college-football/seasons/{year}/types/{season_type}/weeks`.
The index returns one `$ref` per week; this wrapper dereferences each
and returns one row per week (~15-16 for a regular season). The `week`
numbers returned here are the values
[`espn_cfb_week_rankings()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_week_rankings.md)
accepts.
