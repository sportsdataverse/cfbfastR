# **ESPN College Football Franchise Detail**

Get the ESPN core-v2 detail record for a single college football
franchise – location, nickname, abbreviation, color, the associated
venue and current team, and active status.

## Usage

``` r
espn_cfb_franchise(franchise_id = NULL, team_detail = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- franchise_id:

  (*Integer* required): ESPN franchise id.

- team_detail:

  (*Logical*): when `TRUE` (default), the ESPN team catalog
  ([`espn_cfb_teams()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_teams.md))
  is fetched once and friendly team fields are joined in next to the
  `team_id` column. The sibling columns `team_name`,
  `team_abbreviation`, `team_location`, `team_display_name`,
  `team_short_display_name`, `team_nickname`, `team_color`,
  `team_alternate_color`, `team_logo_href`, `team_logo_dark_href` are
  inserted immediately after `team_id`. A catalog failure degrades to
  `NA` rather than erroring the wrapper. Set `FALSE` to skip the catalog
  fetch and the join, reproducing the prior output exactly.

A franchise is the stable program identity, distinct from `/teams`
