# **ESPN College Football Team Awards**

Get the awards won by a college football team's players in a season –
one row per (award x winning athlete).

## Usage

``` r
espn_cfb_team_awards(team_id = NULL, year = NULL, team_detail = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- team_id:

  (*Integer* required): ESPN team id.

- year:

  (*Integer* required): Season, 4 digit format (*YYYY*).

- team_detail:

  (*Logical*): when `TRUE` (default), fetch the ESPN team catalog once
  and join friendly team fields next to every team-id column (`team_id`,
  `winner_team_id`) in the output (see *Details*). Set `FALSE` to skip
  the catalog fetch and the join.

## Details

Wraps the ESPN core-v2 team awards endpoint
`sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/college-football/seasons/{year}/teams/{team_id}/awards`.
The index endpoint returns a `$ref` list of award resources; this
wrapper dereferences each one and returns a row per winning athlete for
the award. Athletes are returned as ESPN athlete ids (parsed from
`athlete_ref`); join to another athlete source for names. Most teams
have only one or two award items in a season.

When `team_detail = TRUE` (the default) the ESPN team catalog
([`espn_cfb_teams()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_teams.md))
is fetched once and friendly team fields are joined onto every team-id
column the output carries – `team_id` and `winner_team_id`. For each id
column `X_id` the friendly siblings `X_name`, `X_abbreviation`,
`X_location`, `X_display_name`, `X_short_display_name`, `X_nickname`,
`X_color`, `X_alternate_color`, `X_logo_href`, and `X_logo_dark_href`
are inserted immediately after it. A catalog failure degrades to `NA`
rather than erroring the wrapper. Set `team_detail = FALSE` to skip the
catalog fetch and the join.
