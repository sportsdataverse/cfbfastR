# **ESPN College Football Weekly Rankings**

Get the ranked teams from every poll ESPN published in a single week of
a college football season – the AP Top 25, the Coaches Poll, the CFP
committee rankings, and the computer polls, with each team's rank,
points, and first-place votes.

## Usage

``` r
espn_cfb_week_rankings(
  year = NULL,
  week = NULL,
  season_type = 2,
  team_detail = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- year:

  (*Integer* required): Season, 4 digit format (*YYYY*).  
  Minimum value accepted: 2002

- week:

  (*Integer* required): Week number within the season type.

- season_type:

  (*Integer* default 2): ESPN season type id. `2` = regular season, `3`
  = postseason.

- team_detail:

  (*Logical*): when `TRUE` (default), fetch the ESPN team catalog once
  and join friendly team fields next to the `team_id` column (see
  *Details*). Set `FALSE` to skip the catalog fetch and the join.

## Value

A data frame with one row per poll-team:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | types | description |

| season_type | integer | ESPN season type id queried. |
| week | integer | Week number queried. |
| ranking_id | character | ESPN poll id. |
| ranking_name | character | Poll name (e.g. `AP Top 25`). |
| ranking_type | character | Poll type code (e.g. `ap`, `coaches`, `cfp`). |
| occurrence | character | Poll occurrence label (e.g. `Week 8`, `Preseason`). |
| rank_type | character | `ranked` for ranked teams, `others` for receiving-votes teams. |

| trend | character | Movement vs the previous poll (e.g. `-`, `+3`). |
| record_summary | character | Team record at the time of the poll (e.g. `7-1`). |
| team_id | character | ESPN team id (parsed from `team_ref`). |
| team_name | character | Team nickname; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_abbreviation | character | Team abbreviation; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_location | character | Team location / school name; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_display_name | character | Full team display name; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_short_display_name | character | Short team display name; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_nickname | character | Team nickname label; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_color | character | Primary team color; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_alternate_color | character | Alternate team color; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |
| team_logo_href | character | Default team logo URL; `team_detail = TRUE` only. |

## Details

Wraps the ESPN core-v2 endpoint
`sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/college-football/seasons/{year}/types/{season_type}/weeks/{week}/rankings`.
The week index returns one `$ref` per poll; this wrapper dereferences
each poll and returns one row per (poll x ranked team). Both the top-25
ranked teams (`rank_type = "ranked"`) and the receiving-votes teams ESPN
lists below the cutoff (`rank_type = "others"`) are included.

When `team_detail = TRUE` (the default) the ESPN team catalog
([`espn_cfb_teams()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_teams.md))
is fetched once and friendly team fields are joined in next to the
`team_id` column – `team_name`, `team_abbreviation`, `team_location`,
`team_display_name`, `team_short_display_name`, `team_nickname`,
`team_color`, `team_alternate_color`, `team_logo_href`, and
`team_logo_dark_href`, inserted immediately after `team_id`. A catalog
failure degrades to `NA` rather than erroring the wrapper. Set
`team_detail = FALSE` to skip the catalog fetch and the join; teams are
then returned as ESPN team ids only.
