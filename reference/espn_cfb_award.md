# **ESPN College Football Award Detail**

Get the ESPN core-v2 detail record for a single college football award
in a given season – name, description, history, and the athlete (and
team) that won it.

## Usage

``` r
espn_cfb_award(award_id = NULL, year = NULL, team_detail = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- award_id:

  (*Integer* required): ESPN award id.

- year:

  (*Integer* required): Season, 4 digit format (*YYYY*).

- team_detail:

  (*Logical*): when `TRUE` (default), the ESPN team catalog
  ([`espn_cfb_teams()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_teams.md))
  is fetched once and friendly team fields are joined in next to the
  `team_id` column. The sibling columns `team_name`,
  `team_abbreviation`, `team_location`, `team_display_name`,
  `team_short_display_name`, `team_nickname`, `team_color`,
  `team_alternate_color`, `team_logo_href`, `team_logo_dark_href` are
  inserted immediately after `team_id`. A catalog failure degrades to
  `NA` rather than erroring the wrapper. Set `FALSE` to skip the catalog
  fetch and the join, reproducing the prior output exactly.

## Value

A data frame with one row per award-winner:

## Details

Wraps the ESPN core-v2 endpoint
`sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/college-football/seasons/{year}/awards/{award_id}`.
[`espn_cfb_awards()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_awards.md)
returns the season award index; this wrapper returns the single-award
detail (including the long-form `history` text) for one id. Returns one
row per (award x winner) – most awards have a single winner, so the
table is typically one row. An award with no winner recorded yet still
contributes one row with `athlete_id`/`team_id` left `NA`. Winners are
returned as ESPN athlete and team ids only – join to an athlete source
for names. Enumerate `award_id`s with
[`espn_cfb_awards()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_awards.md).
