# **ESPN College Football Game Team Leaders**

Get each team's statistical leaders (passing, rushing, receiving, ...)
for a single college football game.

## Usage

``` r
espn_cfb_game_team_leaders(game_id = NULL, team_detail = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- game_id:

  (*Integer* required): ESPN game identifier.

- team_detail:

  (*Logical*): when `TRUE` (default), fetch the ESPN team catalog once
  and join friendly team fields next to the `team_id` and
  `leader_team_id` columns (see *Details*). Set `FALSE` to skip the
  catalog fetch and the join.

## Value

## Details

Wraps the ESPN core-v2 endpoint
`events/{game_id}/competitions/{game_id}/competitors/{team_id}/leaders`.
This wrapper reads the teams list for the game and fetches the leaders
resource for **both** teams, flattening the nested
`categories -> leaders` tree into one long frame: one row per (team x
category x leader). `rank` is the leader's position within the category
(1 = top performer). `display_value` is ESPN's pre-formatted stat line
(e.g. `"18/25, 242 YDS, 5 TD"`).

When `team_detail = TRUE` (the default) the ESPN team catalog
([`espn_cfb_teams()`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/espn_cfb_teams.md))
is fetched once and friendly team fields are joined in next to both
team-id columns – `team_id` gains `team_name`, `team_abbreviation`, ...,
and `leader_team_id` gains `leader_team_name`,
`leader_team_abbreviation`, .... A catalog failure degrades to `NA`
rather than erroring the wrapper. Set `team_detail = FALSE` to skip the
catalog fetch and the join.
