## Details

Wraps the ESPN core-v2 endpoint
`sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/college-football/seasons/{year}/powerindex`.
Returns one row per team-metric in long format: each team contributes
one row for every predictive metric (FPI, projected wins, strength of
record, ...) and every efficiency component (offensive, defensive, and
special-teams efficiency, ...). The long shape is deliberate – ESPN adds
and retires metrics across seasons, and a long frame absorbs that drift
without breaking column expectations. Pivot wider with
[`tidyr::pivot_wider()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html)
keyed on `stat_name` when a wide table is wanted.
